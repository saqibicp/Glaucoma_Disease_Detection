# Glaucoma_Disease_Detection

This project aims to develop a system for detecting glaucoma through deep learning techniques. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, this implementation processes retinal images to classify them as glaucomatous or healthy. The user interface for this project is built using **Tkinter**, a standard Python GUI toolkit, which provides a simple and interactive way for users to upload images and view the results. The model incorporates techniques for automatic region of interest extraction, improving the accuracy of classification.
